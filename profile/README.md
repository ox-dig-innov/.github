## University of Oxford Digital Innovation Team

Welcome to our repo!

We are a small team collaborating across Oxford University. We co-design new ideas and support digital innovation by
- tracking and evaluating emerging technologies
- providing consultancy services to teams across the university
- developing prototypes and proof of concepts to evaluate the potential of new ideas
- advising how to progress ideas beyond the prototyping stage

Our current focus is on AI, immersive, IOT, automation and visualisation technologies.

This repo exists primarily for staff and academia at Oxford University.
